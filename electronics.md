### [flatpack2-adapter](./flatpack2-adapter)
stand-alone adapter board for Eltek Flatpack2 series PSU.  
May also work with the DC-DC converters.

### [esp32-cantroller](./esp32-cantroller)
small ESP32-based CANBUS controller with wide supply voltage input.  
Designed to control one or more flatpack2 devices, but probably useful for other stuff.

### [mPCIe-LEA-M8T](./mpcie-lea-m8t)
mini-PCIe card designed for use with the LEA-M8T timing GPS module.  
Connects module USB interface, JST-SH header for TP1/TP2/UART.  
Intended to be wired to a 1PPS-in GPIO, or intel NIC PTP hardware clock 1PPS input.

### [wireviz-templates]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/wireviz-templates)
technically not electronics, but useful for electronics;  
contains some templates for cables and adapters I've made using [WireViz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz/)
