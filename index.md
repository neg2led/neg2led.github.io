hello. I am neg2led/neggles/sirneggles (depending on where you know me from)  
I like to make stuff, and some of it is published here:

# [electronics projects](./electronics)
this is probably what you're here for, if anything

# [software/code repos](./software)
sometimes I write a program, or contribute to one.

# [pi case 40 shutdown](./pi-case-40)
how to use the shutdown button on a Cooler Master Pi Case 40 without their bloated utility

# [hardware hackery](./hackery)
repurposing and modifying things for fun and profit

# [repos](./repos)
all my public github repos (except forks)
